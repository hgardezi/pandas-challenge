I be helping the school board and mayor make strategic decisions regarding future school budgets and priorities.
I been asked to analyze the district-wide standardized test results
I was given access to every student's math and reading scores, as well as various information on the schools they attend
 My task is to aggregate the data to showcase obvious trends in school performance.
 In District Summary, Perform the necessary calculations like Total number of unique schools
Total students
Total budget
Average math score
Average reading score
% passing math (the percentage of students who passed math)
% passing reading (the percentage of students who passed reading)
% overall passing (the percentage of students who passed math AND reading)
IN School Summary, Perform the necessary calculations like
School name
School type
Total students
Total school budget
Per student budget
Average math score
Average reading score
% passing math (the percentage of students who passed math)
% passing reading (the percentage of students who passed reading)
% overall passing (the percentage of students who passed math AND reading)
Then Sort the schools by % Overall Passing in descending order and display the top 5 rows for highest.
Then Sort the schools by % Overall Passing in descending order and display the top 5 rows for lowest.
Perform the necessary calculations to create a DataFrame that lists the average math score for students of each grade level (9th, 10th, 11th, 12th) at each school.
Create a DataFrame that lists the average reading score for students of each grade level (9th, 10th, 11th, 12th) at each school.
Create a table that breaks down school performance based on average spending ranges (per student).
Use the per_school_summary DataFrame to create a new DataFrame called type_summary.
This new DataFrame should show school performance based on the "School Type"
